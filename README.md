# FlightMonitor

## Summary

FlightMonitor connects to Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 using the SimConnect interface
to get the current position and attitude information of the simulated flight.  The 
position is then broadcast via UDP on the local network to allow the flight to be tracked
with ForeFlight on an iPhone or iPad device.
